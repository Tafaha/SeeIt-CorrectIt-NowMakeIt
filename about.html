            <p id="text"> The University of Advancing Technology is the technophile's college experience—a 
                community uniquely suited to provide students passionate about technology an ideal 
                place to live and grow. UAT is a private and family-owned University that merges 
                the values of the traditional academy with the modern technology campus, a fusion 
                that enhances our ability to fulfill the mission of educating students in the fields 
                of advancing technology who innovate for our future.
                <br><br>
                Learning at UAT extends from our students, staff and faculty to the institution itself. 
                UAT's dedication to learning is reflected in our efforts to create and develop new ways 
                of learning that focus on the personal mission and vision of every member of the UAT 
                community.
                <br><br>
                UAT strives to foster knowledge creation and achieve academic excellence. We are at the 
                forefront of developing academic programs that tend to be unique among academia or emerge 
                years ahead of other schools, such as Network Security and Robotics and Embedded Systems, 
                as well as our established Game Development majors that merged artistic and programming 
                aspects long before other colleges chose that focus for themselves.
